   The current research topic is the development of nanostructured thin
   films of superconducting and thermoelectric oxides. The goals of my
   research are the enhancement of electric current transport of
   superconducting films and improvement of efficiency thermal energy
   conversion of thermoelectric modules based on thin films. The common
   approach for both categories of materials is the nanongineering
   strategy to insert nanosized artificial defects (AD) inside the films.
   In superconductors, ADs act as pinning centers for the magnetic flux
   vortices enhancing the critical current; in thermoelectric films the
   role of ADs is to improve the scattering of phonons leading to lower
   thermal conductivity and enhance efficiency of thermal energy
   conversion. Advanced nanostructured materials will play an important
   role in the current challenge to develop alternative and sustainable
   energy technologies to reduce our dependence on nuclear and fossil
   fuels and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.
